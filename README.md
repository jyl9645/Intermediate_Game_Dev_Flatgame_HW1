# Intermediate_Game_Dev_Flatgame_HW1

For this project, I wanted to create a scrappy experience where you get to explore a fantasy world of animals and plants. I drew the assets with a quick sketch and coloring to give it an amateur look. The highlight of the project is an abandoned tower at the end of the experience to give you a greater feeling of exploration. I added lots of interaction feedback to the game, such as the animals moving and speaking when you pass them as well as pops to indicate when you hit a border. Through these audio/visual feedbacks, I think I learned a lot about how to add triggers and use them for animation and audio cues. To be honest, the process of making this game was a lot more difficult than I expected. I would give it a 5/10 because 2D asset and animation creation was very hard on Unity, which doesnâ€™t have many tools to let you manipulate sprites directly. I spent too much time getting sprites to align in their animations and had to continuously redo them. Overall, this project was still a good step in learning how to use Unity.
